###Please [spay and neuter](http://www.petsmartcharities.org/spay-neuter/locator/) your pets! While your newborn pets are cute, failing to do this allows your little darlings to add to the population of homeless animals. Adopt pets from your [local animal rescues/shelters](http://adopt.pschar.org/), there are plenty of animals just waiting for a home.

* You learn something new every day; what did *you* learn today?
 
* Submit interesting and **specific facts** that you just found out (not broad information you looked up, TodayILearned is not [/r/wikipedia](/r/wikipedia)).
 
#Posting rules#
 
1. Submissions must be verifiable*. Please link directly to a reliable source that supports the claim in your post title.* Images alone do not count as valid references. *Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).*
 
1. No personal opinions, *anecdotes or subjective statements (e.g "TIL xyz is a great movie").*

1. No news or recent sources. *News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) more recent than two months are not allowed.*
 
1. Nothing related to recent politics.
 
1. No misleading claims*. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.*
 
1. *Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:*
   1. *Titles must begin with "TIL ..."*
   1. *Make them descriptive, concise and specific (e.g.* not *"TIL something interesting about bacon").*
   1. *Titles* must be able to stand on their own *without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.*
   1. *"TIL about ..." and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word "about").*
   1. *"TIL how to ..." posts belong on* **/r/HowTo.**
1. *No trivial or obvious facts (e.g. "TIL the sky is blue"), or facts that appeal only to a narrow audience, specifically* no software/website tips *(e.g. "TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22").*
1.  All NSFW links must be tagged *(including comments).*
####  *Please see the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index) for more detailed explanations of the rules.*

1. *avoid mobile versions of websites (e.g. [m.wikipedia.org](http://m.wikipedia.org))*
 
1. *link to the appropriate heading when referencing an article (particularly on Wikipedia)*

**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem.**

[New to reddit? Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)
------------------

1. **Please try not to repost.** Gifs that have been posted recently or frequently to /r/gifs will be deleted, and repeat offenders may be banned. This includes repeatedly removing and reposting your own submissions.  
Cross-posting any recent popular posts from other subreddits may be counted as reposts. This includes popular video posts converted to gif and posted here. Please send us a modmail about videos that violate this rule, with a link to the video post and the /r/gifs post-- these are harder to catch and we appreciate your help.

2. **No Reaction/HIFW (How I Feel When)/Analogy gifs.**

2. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs or content much better suited to video formats may be removed.

3. **Do not make posts specifically about cakeday** (example: "For my cakeday I present to you...")  
This rule does not apply to wishing someone a happy cakeday in the comments and other similar comments.

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, and **no other file formats ~~(HTML5, jpg, png, etc)~~** are allowed - your submission must be a single gif image. **.gif format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **Mark your risque posts as NSFW**; this implies the comments within will be too.

6. ***Nudity, porn, gore, and other obscene material are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.***  If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. Please refer to /r/nsfw_gifs or /r/nsfw_gif

7. **Titles must be descriptive.** Do not make submissions with the title "This", "This is my favorite gif", and etc.

8. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, or homophobic submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

9. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).**

Welcome to the official subreddit of the PC Master Race!

**This is not a satirical or circlejerk subreddit nor did it start as one. This is a normal subreddit with satirical &amp; circlejerk humor elements.**

Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend to the Master Race.

**You don't need a top-of-the-line gaming PC to be a member of the Master Race. You don't even need to own a PC. You just have to recognize that PC is objectively superior to consoles in every way possible [as explained here](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide)!**

**Check out our [repository](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/repository), [PC part lists](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds), [Mumble server](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/mumbleguide), and our other various [popular wiki pages and guides](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/index)!**

 - **Follow the rules below:**
 - **Rule #1** Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone.
 - **Rule #2** Follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). We will not allow behavior contrary to reddiquette, especially brigading, witch-hunting, vote manipulation, and flamebaiting.
 - **Rule #3** Do not link directly to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links, which aren't allowed either.
 - **Rule #4** Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube and other social networks' comments and discussions should have the usernames blacked out (this includes yours!). Celebrities are the exception.
 - **Rule #5** No referral or affiliate links.
 - **Rule #6** Memes are allowed as long as the image and/or text is relevant to what is usually discussed here and they aren't blatant reposts or low-effort. Reaction images are **not** allowed as submissions
 - **Rule #7** Linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies is not acceptable in the slightest. Age, nationality, race, gender, sexuality, and religion are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race.
 - **Rule #8** No begging.
 - **Rule #9** Do not mark your post as NSFW unless it actually is NSFW. 
 - If your post doesn't show up immediately it might have been caught by the spam bot. Please do not delete your submission, but [message the mod team instead](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpcmasterrace).
 - The Master Race is generous. When we do giveaways we do it within the bounds of our subreddit. **Feel free to give the games as you see fit**, but refrain from demanding subscribes and comments on your YouTube channel and whatnot. You can post about your channel, just don't make it a requirement to subscribe or comment there to get prizes. We prefer image screenshots of keys, since *key-stealing bots can take your keys* if you post them in plaintext. Also consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
 - Charity submissions must be verified by moderators.
 - Snoo by KeyFramez and banner by /u/tanya3

- primarily concerns politics.
- has a title not taken from the article.
- has a pay wall or steals content.
- covers an already-submitted story.
- violates [reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/), especially regarding personal info.

Your comment will likely be removed if it:

- is racist, sexist, vitriolic, or overly crude.
- is unnecessarily rude or provocative.
- is a cheap and distracting joke or meme.
- is responding to spam.
- violates [reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/).

Extreme or repeat offenders will be banned.

*Showerthought* is a loose term that applies to any thought you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming.

Please be respectful of others submissions, if you disagree - explain why in the comments. Rudeness is unacceptable.

###Welcome! Please read [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index) before participating.

# **/r/Politics is the subreddit for current and explicitly political U.S. news.**

## [Our full rules](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs) 

## [Reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette)

------

#Comment Guidelines:

##Be civil.
* Treat others with basic decency. No personal attacks, hate-speech, flaming, baiting, trolling, witch-hunting, or unsubstantiated accusations. Threats of violence will result in a ban. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) 

##Do not post users' personal information.
* Users who violate this rule will be banned on sight. Witch-hunting and giving out private personal details of other people can result in unexpected and potentially serious consequences for the individual targeted. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_no_threats.2C_witch_hunting.2C_or_personal_information.)

##Vote based on **quality**, not opinion.
* Political discussion requires varied opinions. Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it. Downvote only if you think a comment/post does not contribute to the thread it is posted in or if it is off-topic in /r/politics. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_voting)

##Do not manipulate comments and posts via group voting.
* Manipulating comments and posts via group voting is against reddit TOS. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_do_not_manipulate_comments_and_posts_via_group_voting.)

##Use "no participation" links when linking to other subreddits.
*  Please use np.reddit.com links if you wish to link threads found on /r/politics to an outside subreddit. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_use_.22no_participation.22_links_when_linking_to_other_subreddits.)


-----

#Submission Guidelines:

##Articles must deal ***explicitly*** with US politics.
* [**See our on-topic statement here.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement)

##Articles must be published within the last 45 days.
* [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement)

##Post titles must be **exact** headline and/or quotes. 
* Your title should be comprised only of the copied and pasted headline of the article and/or **exact** quotes. The selection of quotes should reflect the article as a whole. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_do_not_create_your_own_title.)

##Submissions must be an original source.
* An article must contain significant analysis and original content--not just a few links of text among chunks of copy and pasted material. Content is considered rehosted when a publication takes the majority of their content from another website and reposts it in order to get the traffic and collect ad revenue. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_ensure_that_you_are_using_the_original_source)

##Spam is bad!
* If 33% or more of your submissions are from a single website, you will be banned as a spammer. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_spam_is_bad.21) 

##Submissions must be articles, videos or sound clips. 
* We disallow petitions, polls, personal blogs, satire, images, social media content (facebook, twitter, tumblr, LinkedIn, etc.), wikis, memes, and political advertisements. More info: [**Content type rules.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_submissions_must_be_articles.2C_videos.2C_or_sound_clips.)

##Do not use "BREAKING" or ALL CAPS in titles. 
* The ALL CAPS and 'Breaking' rule is applied even when the actual title of the article is in all caps or contains the word 'Breaking'. This rule may be applied to other single word declarative and/or sensational expressions, such as 'EXCLUSIVE:' or 'HOT:'. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_follow_reddiquette.27s_title_instructions.) 

##Self-Posts are allowed on Saturdays. 
* Self posts must adhere to our [on topic statement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement). Meta posts (posts about /r/Politics and not the topic of politics) are not allowed. Please message the mods with your feedback about the subreddit. [**More Info.**](/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_self-posts_are_allowed_on_saturdays.)
